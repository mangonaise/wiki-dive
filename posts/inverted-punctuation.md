Every language has its quirks. Spanish presents: the punctuation sandwich.

> ¡Me encantan los sándwiches!

In written Spanish, exclamations and questions are wrapped in two punctuation marks, with the first being turned upside down - something that I always found very stylish. But it does more than just add pizzazz to the page, and it's been around for a long time. So why *does* Spanish have inverted punctuation? And while we're on the subject, should other languages be joining in?

There are a couple ways to approach that first question. One answer is simply "because those are the rules".

I mean that literally. Spanish has rules, and a regulatory body that sets out those rules. The English language has no such thing, but it's otherwise actually pretty common to have these so-called language regulators. Some are motivated by a desire to maintain and enforce the "purity" of the language, but generally they exist to provide clear, standardized orthography rules for all populations to refer to. This helps to keep writing more consistent, and in some cases simpler and with less ambiguity. You could say that it purifies, it fixes, and it dignifies.

That's the slogan of the *Real Academia Española* (RAE), the institution responsible for regulating the Spanish language. Its name translates to "Royal Spanish Academy", and it's been around since 1713. They decided to give Spanish a spelling makeover as recently as 2010, when it was decreed that several words should no longer be written with accents. Speakers, educators and learners of the language are required to pay attention to these changes so as not to perpetuate an outdated writing style.

The RAE is very important to today's story, because they were the ones who single-handedly brought upside-down punctuation into the Spanish writing system. In the 1754 edition of the *Ortografía*, the idea was presented as a solution to a problem of precision. The issue, as documented in the *Ortografía*, was that long sentences with a question mark at the end were becoming inconvenient to read. For starters, you don't find out that there's even a question until the very last moment. And then there's the issue of clarity. If you put the question mark at the end, how do you know where the writer's "questioning tone" really begins? I've translated these frustrations:

> [A question mark] should be placed after any sentence, or clause in which a question is asked, e.g. *Who is listening to me? How is it?* But this does not always satisfy all that is necessary; since there are long sentences where a question mark placed at the end is not sufficient for them to be read with their true meaning: failing to indicate, as is convenient and precise, where the questioning tone begins and continues until it resolves at the end of the sentence.

It is here that the RAE proposes a new symbol to alleviate this inconvenience.

> ... after a long examination, it appears to the Academy that the same question mark can be used, putting it inversely before the word where the questioning tone begins, in addition to the one at the end in its regular form, in order to avoid the misunderstanding that is commonly suffered, due to the lack of a second mark, in the reading of long sentences.

Thus, inverted question marks are to be used for interrogative sentences. But for even more clarity, they should be used for smaller parts of sentences when only that part presents a question, for example:

> *Now that you're here, can we eat these sandwiches?*

> Ahora que estás aquí, ¿podemos comer estos sándwiches?

For even longer sentences, the inverted mark gives the reader a helpful and clear indication of exactly where the question begins. The *Ortografía* then goes on to apply the same rule to exclamation marks. So there you have it. After 1754, Spanish writing was forever changed, all because some language regulators didn't like waiting until the end of a sentence to figure out how it should have been interpreted.

That sounds like a pretty good reason on its own. Inverted punctuation, in theory, reduces the amount of time you have to spend processing what you've read. You reach the end of a sentence, and there's a question mark. But you don't have to re-interpret the sentence with that new information - because it's *not* new information.

But hold up. Let's go back to that example from before.

> Now that you're here, can we eat these sandwiches?

An upside-down question mark would be totally pointless here! The start of the questioning clause is obvious, because the word order is different. It's written as "*can we* eat" instead of "*we can* eat", which would be a statement. Is inverted punctuation just a waste of time?

But there is a piece missing from the story here. There's a reason why Spanish in particular benefits from that second question mark more than English. Let's look again at how to say "Can we eat these sandwiches?" in Spanish:

> ¿Podemos comer estos sándwiches?

Okay. Now the statement "We can eat these sandwiches":

> Podemos comer estos sándwiches.

Same words, same order. So, unlike English and many other written languages, there is often no evidence of a question except for the presence of punctuation. It makes a lot of sense, then, that the Spanish writing system would benefit more from a "warning" question mark. Imagine a long sentence, worded identically to its statement counterpart. Now imagine that it's split across two pages in a book. Suddenly it all becomes clear how useful inverted punctuation can be.

So, should we adopt this system in other languages? Some languages with similar grammar to Spanish, such as Italian or Portuguese, would enjoy some of the benefits mentioned, but it's highly unlikely that their regulatory bodies would demand such a significant orthography shift at this point in history. In some other languages, such as English and German, inverted question marks would only be useful very occasionally, due to the fact that changing the word order usually does the job. Exclamations would perhaps benefit slightly more, but since they are widely considered poor style in writing, I'm not expecting an exclamation revolution any time soon. 

Part of me feels that we should just let Spanish keep inverted punctuation for itself. It's one of the things that make the language unique, and I wouldn't want to see that taken away.

That's enough from me for now. I love language, and so I got a bit carried away today, but there is still more to learn about upside-down punctuation.

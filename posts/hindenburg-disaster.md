Nothing says "the future is now" more than things that fly. We've got planes, helicopters, spacecraft - all these incredibly advanced machines that soar through the sky and beyond, embodying all of humanity's technological progress. But there is still something surreal, almost science-fiction-like, about airships. Watching old footage of zeppelins, some the size of skyscrapers, as they slowly drift while casting their enormous shadows over entire cities, you can really get a sense of the amazement that people of the time would have felt. Despite being not much more than oversized balloons, airships defy their primitive nature with sheer scale, power, and the promise of a technology-dominated future.

But that promise, that ideal world where fleets of commercial zeppelins carry passengers around the globe, was doomed. The reputation of airships somehow survived a decades-long string of several dozen disasters in the early 20th century. But one catastrophe changed everything - including, vitally, public perception. Widespread fear and disapproval following the disaster ultimately destroyed the business of passenger airship flights.

That fateful event was, of course, the *Hindenburg* disaster of 1937. Exceedingly well documented, the many photos and videos of the disaster shook the world. Images of the colossal ship being enveloped by flames are staggering, and footage of passengers escaping from the skeletal wreckage is just the stuff of nightmares. There were 97 people on board, of which 35 people died. One man was killed on the ground, and many suffered burns and other injuries. After news and footage of the catastrophe spread, commercial airships swiftly went out of use.

The LZ 129 *Hindenburg* was one of the two zeppelins in its class to be constructed; they were the largest airships ever built. Behind the cotton-canvas skin was a huge lattice of metal girders which gave the ship its shape. Most of the space inside was occupied by sixteen large gas cells, allowing the ship to be buoyant. Passengers rested and dined in a small two-deck area at the bottom of the ship's hull. 

In 1936, *Hindenburg* made 17 trips across the Atlantic - 7 to Rio de Janeiro and 10 to New York City. The airship exuded power and success. Bearing four enormous swastikas, *Hindenburg* was in large part a tool used to display the prowess of Nazi Germany, both internally as propaganda and also to the rest of the world. Confidence in *Hindenburg* was high, and before the disaster there had been no injuries on a German passenger airship. This would have played a part in the continued use of hydrogen instead of helium as the vehicle's lifting gas. The ship was designed to be used with helium as it is not flammable, but it was rare and expensive, and the US - who sourced much of the gas - had imposed an export ban on it. Thus hydrogen, the only other viable alternative lighter-than-air gas, was used in spite of the massive risk - hydrogen's extreme flammability was the ultimate cause of the disaster.

On the day of the catastrophe, the ship was already 12 hours late as it approached its landing site at Lakehurst, New Jersey. As it circled towards its destination, the stern of the ship was low. It's possible that there was a hydrogen leak, and attempts to stabilize the ship failed. Its mooring lines were dropped, but disaster struck just minutes later. The rear of the airship suddenly burst into flames, and the once-graceful *Hindenburg* quickly began to fall. The tail crashed into the ground while the bow was sent upwards. Flames began to spew from the nose of the ship, and within seconds *Hindenburg* had been consumed by fire, leaving behind nothing but its charred aluminum bones. 

Surprisingly, 62 people managed to survive. Passengers preparing to land would have been waiting on the lower deck, where large panoramic windows looked out towards the ground. The fortunate ones on board were able to jump through these windows and run from the burning wreckage, some miraculously uninjured. Officers in the ship's control car were also able to escape through its windows. Commanding captain Max Pruss was seen lingering around the crashed ship searching for survivors. He suffered severe facial burns but managed to make it out alive. 

Still, the lives of 13 passengers and 22 crew were lost on that day. Some jumped from the ship while it was too far from the ground, and others burned to death. This was all captured on film, and witnesses watched in horror. It was a tragedy that would not be quickly forgotten.

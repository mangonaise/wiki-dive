Extinctions are nothing new: almost all of the several billion species that have existed on Earth aren't around anymore. What is relatively new, though, is the invention of cameras. We're living in a new age, one where extinct species have been immortalized in picture and video. Watching footage of these animals is a truly strange experience. It's heartbreaking to see videos of these beautiful creatures with the knowledge that they no longer walk the earth, especially in cases where human activity drove them to extinction.

Today's article is about the thylacine, otherwise known as the Tasmanian tiger. It was a magnificent animal, a marsupial that looked like a combination of a tiger and a wolf, with a striped back and thoughtful eyes. Unfortunately, only [footage of thylacines in captivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RPap1BWYns) exists.

Native to Australia and nearby islands, by the time of the British settlement the thylacine was already extinct on the mainland. The species was rare, but still present, on the island of Tasmania. Considered a pest due to attacks on livestock, bounty schemes were created to reduce the thylacine population. Although other factors were at play, the work of bounty hunters contributed greatly to the demise of the species.

With extinction on the horizon, thylacine breeding pairs were sent to zoos around the world in a desperate but unsuccessful attempt to keep the species alive. Conditions were extremely poor, and the animals could not thrive in captivity, certainly not with the improper treatment and inadequate enclosures provided to them at the time. The last captive thylacine, "Benjamin", died in 1936 when it was left locked outside at night in the extreme cold. Sightings of the creature in the wild continued to be reported, but the resulting extensive searches never led to the discovery of any surviving thylacine populations. The species was officially moved from "endangered" status to "extinct" in 1982.

The story of the thylacine is a tragic one, and it acts as a harsh reminder of the damage humans have caused to nature. The few precious records we have of the creature should motivate us, as the species with the most potential for both harm and good, to respect the other lifeforms with which we share this planet.

There's so much more to learn about thylacines, and it's all wonderfully documented in today's article, which also includes a collection of historical photographs and videos. To continue your dive into this topic, follow the link below.

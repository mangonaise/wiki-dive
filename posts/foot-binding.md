Human cultures have shown a strange obsession with beauty standards that involve deformation of the body. Whether it was corsets, neck rings, or head flattening, deep-rooted traditions and strong social pressures have forced billions of people throughout history to endure extreme pain and permanent disfigurement. Today's article is about a banned Chinese custom which is equal parts fascinating and disturbing: foot binding.

The practice was widely performed on young girls during a period of around a thousand years between the 10th and 20th century. The girls, usually between four to six years old, would have their toes forcibly curled downwards and squeezed underneath the sole of the foot, breaking them. With the big toe left intact, the resulting shape was a small, pointed triangle. The arch of the foot was then broken. A binding cloth would be wrapped tightly, pulling the heel towards the ball of the foot, which caused the broken foot to fold into a drastic curve.

The process was incredibly painful. Multiple times per week, a girl's feet would be unbound, washed, then rebound, each time a little tighter. The rebinding process continued into adulthood. The deformation left women with a permanent disability, making it impossible to run or walk quickly, resulting in a lack of independence and considerable discomfort.

Girls were told that they would not be able to marry unless they had tiny, bound feet. In the culture, small feet were considered to be beautiful, even erotic. Bound feet were said to resemble lotus flowers. A foot three inches in length was called a "golden lotus", thought to be highly desirable in a bride.

At one point, around half of all Chinese women had bound feet, and in the upper class it even approached 100%. Once ubiquitous, the practice had thankfully died out by the middle of the 20th century as it finally became viewed as a backwards, cruel practice that oppressed women. Today, only a handful of elderly women with bound feet remain. These people were truly made of tough stuff, and the stories of what they endured should not be forgotten.

I highly recommend diving into today's article. The subject matter is important to be aware of, and the details are fascinating. To read more, follow the link below.

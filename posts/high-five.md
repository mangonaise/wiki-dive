I'd like to take a brief moment just to appreciate that there is an entire Wikipedia article dedicated to high fives. It has more details than you'd ever need to know about the history and variations of the gesture. Better yet, it's complete with photographs, and they are glorious. Thank goodness the future of civilization will know about "up high, down low, too slow". 

In all seriousness, I love that these little quirks of human behavior are being documented. Aliens discovering the human race through Wikipedia will see that we aren't emotionless robots. We need to let out our joy, and sometimes that just involves slapping hands. 

Today's article made me realize that I had never given a second thought to the fact that the high five must have come from somewhere. I've been slapping palms my whole life; I just never had to think about it. So to find out that it is a relatively recent invention - it didn't enter the dictionary until 1980 - was a big surprise.

It will never be known for certain who participated in the first ever high five. However, it's widely thought that the original appearance of the gesture was on October 2, 1977, at a baseball game in LA. Dusty Baker of the Los Angeles Dodgers had just hit his 30th home run of the season, after great anticipation. The stadium erupted in celebration, and outfielder Glenn Burke ran onto the field to congratulate Baker. Overwhelmed with pride and excitement, Burke's hand was raised above his head. The rest is history.

> It was a wild, triumphant moment and a good omen as the Dodgers headed to the playoffs. Burke, waiting on deck, thrust his hand enthusiastically over his head to greet his friend at the plate. Baker, not knowing what to do, smacked it. "His hand was up in the air, and he was arching way back," says Baker ... "So I reached up and hit his hand. It seemed like the thing to do."

So it turns out the high five was not an invention after all, but instead a sort of involuntary, natural consequence of raw joy and exhilaration. The high five was adopted by the Dodgers, and was used as their salute during the 1980 season, to be used following home runs and victories. People took notice of this symbol of celebration, and it quickly spread beyond the world of sports. Today, the high five is universal.

Today's article is surprisingly informative. I think it's a must-read, if only for the wonderful photographs of variations on the classic high five. To dive into this topic, follow the link below.

Significant progress within the LGBT movement is a relatively recent achievement. If we take the United States as an example, it wasn't until around 2011 that a majority of the public finally came around to supporting marriage equality.

Of course, being LGBT did not become more normal, only more normalized. It has always been an entirely non-radical concept. Queer people have known this throughout all of history, but have had to keep it a secret out of self-preservation.

Key to progress has been representation on the screen. Film is a truly special art form, with its power to transport people out of their own lives - and, by extension, away from their own prejudices. If done correctly, a film can invite a viewer to sympathize with someone that they would have otherwise shunned in real life.

LGBT advocates saw the potential of cinema in its earliest days. But film, like any other media, was subject to censorship, which silenced the voices of those most in need of representation. For example, in the US, the Production Code prevented movies from depicting homosexuality as it fell under "sex perversion".

Under the rule of Nazi Germany, all media was tightly controlled, with film being treated as high-risk. But for a brief time before Hitler's appointment as chancellor in 1933, there was the Reimar Republic, which emerged after World War I. The Reimar Republic saw plenty of crisis in its day, but one thing to note is that the constitution of this post-war German state was explicitly anti-censorship.

It's in this era that our story begins. Magnus Hirschfeld, a Berlin-based doctor, had been offering therapy to gay patients struggling with shame and depression. Hirschfeld himself was gay, and this, combined with the fact that many of his patients took their own lives as a result of guilt and social persecution, gave him the drive to transform public opinion on LGBT people and relationships. So, with the simultaneous births of both the film industry and the less-restrictive Reimar Republic, Hirschfeld took the opportunity to co-write and fund a new movie titled *Anders als die Andern*.

The film's name translates to *Different from the Others*, and it was created mainly as a response to Paragraph 175, which made homosexuality a crime under German law. Portraying a romance between two men, the backlash it eventually caused was inevitable, but the film was actually embraced by its audience when it premiered in 1919. *Different from the Others* approaches homosexuality from a sympathetic angle; the romance is described as being totally normal, and the homophobia suffered by the two lovers is presented as a cruel injustice.

Magnus Hirschfeld essentially plays as himself, a doctor who offers counsel to people struggling with their sexuality. The doctor assures the main character that his love for another man is not perverse or unnatural, and that the problem does not lie within him, but society:

> Love for one of the same sex is no less pure or noble than for one of the opposite. This orientation can be found in all levels of society, and among respected people. Those that say otherwise come only from ignorance and bigotry.

The doctor offers such simple, straightforward truths that echo modern sentiments. The century-old film's message is simply that all love is equal. This fact has been understood by LGBT people for much longer than society has been prepared to listen.

*Different from the Others* was a brief glimmer of hope, but it didn't take long before conservative and homophobic groups started fighting back. In direct response to the film, new censorship laws were created which prevented public screenings after 1920. In classic homophobic fashion, it was deemed to be dangerous to young people as it could be used to convert them to homosexuals.

After the Nazis came into power in the 1930s, they burned all known copies of the film. Only fragments remain, discovered in a scrambled form in Ukraine. A reconstruction of the film was attempted, but the plot is complex and interwoven with flashbacks, so the work in its intended form has been lost.

Thought to be the first ever pro-gay film, *Different from the Others* was still a key moment in LGBT history. It's thanks to people like Magnus Hirschfeld, and others with the courage to shine a light on queer existence in a historically homophobic and transphobic world, that people can love without shame or fear.

Today's article is really fascinating, and there's a lot more to learn. I've deliberately left out the plot summary so that you can find out the story of *Different from the Others* on your own. It's one of love, blackmail, suicide, and hope. To read it, follow the link below.

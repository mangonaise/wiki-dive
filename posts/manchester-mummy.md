In the 1700s, there was rising hysteria surrounding the macabre subject of premature burial. And rightly so - the thought of scratching desperately at the inside of a coffin is pretty gruesome, and around this time in history, it was certainly something that happened on occasion. 

Hannah Beswick was not in the mood to take any chances. 

Born in 1688 in Lancashire, England, Beswick was particularly terrified of being buried alive. For her, it wasn't just the stuff of nightmares; her brother John had a very, very close call. As the story goes, moments before his coffin lid was to be closed, John's eyelids began to flicker. The family doctor then determined that the man was in fact still alive, merely unconscious. John managed to survive his own funeral, and lived for years afterwards.

Unfortunately for our friend Hannah, after witnessing this near-disaster she became fixated on ensuring the same did not happen to her. In anticipation of her death in 1758, she made a very important request in her will: after being pronounced dead, she would not be immediately buried, but instead kept on the surface to be checked for any signs of life Ã  la John.

Her wishes were respected, and she remained above ground. Seemingly unable to resist temptation, Charles White - the family doctor from before - mummified Hannah's cadaver, embalming her by injecting turpentine and vermilion into her arteries. It wasn't the first dead body in White's collection. 

It turns out she was kept around for quite some time - more than 110 years, in fact. She spent much of her time as an exhibit at the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, eventually being dubbed the Manchester Mummy. There, she became a celebrity, fascinating the museum's visitors for years.

After the museum experienced a change in ownership, it was time for Hannah Beswick's story to come to an end. Her legendary status was dwindling, and she wasn't looking her best, with her face being described as "shrivelled and black". In other words, definitely dead. In 1868, she was finally buried.

In the end, Beswick got what she really wanted. Plus, I'm sure that one of the thousands of museum-goers staring at her body would have noticed something if she was still alive in there. She can rest easy now.

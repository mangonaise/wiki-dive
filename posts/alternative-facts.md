In January 2017, the English language was graced by a new expression. Spoken in such an effortless, throwaway manner, the phrase's inventor appeared oblivious to the contradiction within. Two words, forming one elegant oxymoron: "alternative facts".

The woman who bestowed upon us this great linguistic gift was none other than Kellyanne Conway, who was the manager of Donald Trump's first presidential campaign and later became Counselor to the President following his inauguration. Conway was active with the press and appeared on several television interviews. In this time it became clear that she was a master of deflection, with viewers and interviewers alike becoming frustrated by her tendency to give tangential and disingenuous responses.

It was in one of these TV interviews that the phrase was born. For context, press secretary Sean Spicer had recently insisted that the crowd for Trump's inaugural ceremony was the largest of any inauguration in history, a claim which was shown to be false through photographs and public transport ridership data. Responding to a question about Spicer's false statements, Conway said:

> Our press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to that ...

Social media users reacted immediately, and journalists were quick to supply their own criticisms. One common remark was that the phrase was distinctly Orwellian. Especially given its appearance in a political context, "alternative facts" certainly reminds me of the kind of doublethink you'd find in the dystopian world of *1984*. Sales of the novel suddenly exploded after Conway's interview, increasing 95-fold within four days.

The phrase was viewed by some as a sign of an increasingly dangerous phenomenon where political biases cause truth to be discarded in favor of falsehoods. Although Sean Spicer's claims about inauguration attendance were relatively harmless, Trump's alternative fact that the COVID-19 pandemic would "disappear" is not as easy to poke fun at, especially after the deaths of over 600,000 Americans.

"Alternative facts" has gained an iconic status. Some say that the expression symbolizes a dark period in political history, but the popularity of the phrase is also indicative of healthy political skepticism on a broader scale. That's just my alternative fact, anyway.

In 1970, a group of Soviet researchers asked themselves, "How low can you go?" The result: a hole so deep, legend has it Adele can be found rolling in it.

If you find yourself in the middle of nowhere near the border between Norway and the Pechengsky District of Russia, you might come across an unusual abandoned structure. Hidden within the rubble, you'd discover a rusted metal plate fixed to the ground. Just looking at it, you'd have no idea that it conceals a hole 7.6 miles deep, the closest to the center of the Earth that human technology has ever gone. Welcome to the *Kola Superdeep Borehole*.

So, why does it exist? In a word: science. We can only make educated guesses about what's inside and beneath the Earth's crust, for example by studying seismic waves - but there's still a lot we don't know about what's really down there. The team behind the Kola Superdeep Borehole wanted to learn more about the nature of the deep crust, and also to find out what happens in the transition from upper to lower crust. The goal was to reach a depth of 15,000m (49,000ft). Although they only made it to 12,262m (40,230ft), the project still produced several valuable scientific discoveries, many of which were surprising.

For example, the Russian scientists weren't expecting to find microscopic plankton fossils as far as 4 miles deep. Another surprise around this depth was the presence of water, found deeper than scientists had thought possible. Not just your usual lake or ocean water, this stuff was thought to have been produced when extremely high pressures essentially squeezed hydrogen and oxygen out of minerals - the process was a new discovery. Also, the challenge of drilling at such great depths prompted the development of new technologies, such as advanced instruments used to study the rock that could not be transported to the surface.

Eventually, the ground became impossible to drill through, being described as plastic-like due to high temperatures of 180°C (356°F). After a little over two decades, the project was halted, and the record-breaking borehole was welded tightly shut.

The hole surpassed the depth of the Mariana Trench, but relatively speaking that's just scratching the surface. We didn't even make it 0.2% of the way towards the center of the planet. The Earth is big, and we are small. Still, the Kola Superdeep Borehole was a great scientific achievement, and its findings were anything but boring.

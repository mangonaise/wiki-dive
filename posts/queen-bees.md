I didn't know a lot about honey bees until recently. Now that I do, I may never be the same again. Pretty much everything about them is either weird, disturbing, or otherwise insane. This kind of knowledge just changes a person. So, let us begin our dive into the strange world of queen bees. Prepare thyself.

The queen bee is the heart of the hive. She spends most of her life just chilling and laying eggs. The worker bees, which are the queen's daughters, protect and serve the queen. As she is the only one capable of laying fertilized eggs, if there's no queen, there's no colony.

To create a new queen, the old queen will need some way to fertilize her eggs. Unfertilized eggs actually become male bees, otherwise known as drones. These drones have one job, and once they've completed it, they just die. Their purpose is to mate with an existing queen bee. This mating process is... explosive for the male, whose abdomen ruptures, usually killing him.

Let us swiftly move on from that. The existing queen bee will lay eggs regardless of whether she has mated, but if she has, she's able to release sperm into certain eggs while they are being laid. All of these fertilized eggs have the potential to become a queen bee. However, most of the larvae are merely fed "bee bread", which is a blend of nectar and pollen, and these will grow up to become normal female worker bees. The larvae that are exclusively fed nutrient-rich "royal jelly" are the ones that end up becoming queens.

Then things get violent. A colony generally has only one queen, so when a virgin queen chews her way out of her specially crafted queen cell, her first mission is to eliminate the competition. She will invade the cells of unhatched queens, and murder them. If any other virgin queens have emerged, then they will fight to the death using their stingers until there is only one left. Nature is metal. Mercifully, the previous queen will usually be permitted to live until she dies naturally, and the new queen replaces her.

Between six and ten days after the new queen emerges, she has to mate quickly. Mating takes place in flight, and so if weather prevents it, the queen will remain unmated, only producing useless male drones and thus dooming the colony. If the queen is successful, she will collect up to six million sperm from around a dozen drones, which will keep her busy for the rest of her life. 

Unlike the rest of the bee population, which live months at most, the queen bee can live for several years. Throughout this time, multiple generations of worker bees will care for the queen, feeding her and cleaning up her excrement, as she goes around doing not much else other than laying eggs into the cells of the hive. With the right diet and conditions, the queen will lay around 1,500 eggs per day.

If the worker bees aren't happy with the performance of the queen, they will do something about it. The queen can become injured or diseased, or the worker bees may sense that the queen won't be able to lay fertile eggs. This can cause the workers to prepare a new queen, and in such cases the old queen is often killed, which is known as supersedure. The replacement queen can achieve this by stinging her predecessor to death. However, there is another method that has been observed, known as balling, where dozens of workers will huddle around the old queen, heating her up until she is essentially cooked to death. Fun.

Despite being horrifying at times, honey bee societies are truly amazing and complex. I've only touched the surface here, and I highly recommend reading today's article. As always, it's linked below.

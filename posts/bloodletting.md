If you're reading this, congratulations! You weren't born in an era where indigestion might be treated by taking a vicious device with a dozen razor blades, and slicing you with it until you lose consciousness from blood loss. Hooray.

Today's article is about bloodletting, the ancient medical practice of removing a patient's blood in an attempt to cure disease. One of the most common and accepted treatments for thousands of years, it was performed all the way into the late 19th century, at which point people finally started to realize that it's kind of bad for you.

It's thought that bloodletting could have been performed as far back as in ancient Egypt, but the practice is better documented from the 5th century BC onwards. It was used in ancient Greece during the lifetime of "Father of Medicine" Hippocrates.

So, why was losing blood *ever* considered a useful treatment? It all relates to the system of four "humors". Humorism deserves its own dedicated post, but here's a brief summary. Hippocrates suggested that the human body contains four essential bodily fluids (humors): blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. If these four humors aren't perfectly balanced, this can cause disease. So, according to the medical school of thought at the time, diseases must be treated by restoring the humoral balance - which can be achieved by withdrawing blood.

Some of the tools used for bloodletting were absolutely gruesome. Easily the most horrifying device was the [scarificator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ial9GE8fVM). This instrument has several slits from which terrifying little blades pop out and mechanically slice through your skin. Later in the bloodletting age, leeches began to be used. I can't decide whether that's more or less disturbing, but at least leeches were more localized and easier to control. By the way, if you found yourself fainting due to blood loss, don't worry! That just meant it was working.

With our modern understanding of medicine, it's pretty wild to think that this was such a common practice for so long. Unsurprisingly, it's now thought to be purely harmful in most cases. But bloodletting was used for basically every disease back in the day, and worse still, this "treatment" was common even for people who weren't sick, as it was considered a good way to prevent illness. Who knows how much unnecessary suffering (even death!) was caused by ancient medicine.

Well, it feels like a good opportunity to take a moment to be grateful that we're alive at this time in history. 

If you're interested, there is much more to learn about bloodletting, including how it's still used in very specific cases today - thankfully, it doesn't involve scarificators anymore.

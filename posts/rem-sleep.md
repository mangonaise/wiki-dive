It's a question that has perplexed humanity for millennia: why do we dream?

Well, we still don't really know for sure. The brain does some really weird and specific stuff while it's asleep, and all of it seems to be extremely important but none of it seems to make much sense. Today's article is all about the rapid eye movement phase of sleep, or REM, which is generally when dreaming occurs. Although we typically associate sleep with rest, your brain during REM sleep is as active as your brain during wakefulness, which is why it's sometimes referred to as *paradoxical sleep*. It appears in all mammals and also in birds, and being deprived of it can lead to psychological problems and increased risk of mortality. REM sleep is clearly essential, but at this point in scientific history its true function remains poorly understood.

As the name suggests, REM involves rapid, erratic movement of the eyes. This appears to be a side effect of the bursts of electrical activity which start in the brain stem and flow to the visual cortex. Breathing and heart rate also become highly unpredictable. Areas of the forebrain linked to memories, emotions and sex become more active, which is thought to manifest in the content of dreams. The brain inhibits motor neurons across the entire body, which leaves you temporarily paralyzed. This is a good thing though, as it prevents you from acting out your dreams, which could otherwise cause injury to yourself or others. It takes time for the effect to wear off, so if your REM sleep is disturbed, you can find yourself fully awake but momentarily unable to move (known as sleep paralysis), and it can be pretty frightening.

Your brain goes through all this every single day (ideally). But what's the point?

That's where things get a little fuzzy. There is some scientific literature about REM, but the brain is also extremely complex and there's a lot we don't know. One argument that has some evidence is that REM is important for brain development. Newborn babies spend over 80% of their time asleep in REM (that number stands at around 20-25% in adults). It's been suggested that the stimulation from REM helps to form neural connections as the brain develops. REM sleep is also thought to play an important role in memory consolidation. Interestingly, that seems to lean towards types of memory related to your experience of the world, like emotional memory, spatial memory and procedural memory (think learning to ski or play piano).

Whatever the precise purpose of REM sleep, it's definitely something you don't want to live without. Even if we don't fully understand it, our brains seem to know what they're doing. Make sure you give your mind a chance to do its thing by making it a top priority to get a good night's rest.

Today's article is another fascinating read. At a few points it's a little heavy on the science, but I spent most of the time thinking "My brain does *that*?!" Follow the link below for more interesting details about REM sleep. Until next time, sweet dreams.

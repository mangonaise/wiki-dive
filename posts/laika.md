The history of spaceflight is no longer short. Over the past several decades, great things have been achieved, but by now the world has also witnessed a number of disasters that have claimed many lives, including human ones. After all this time, there is still something particularly heartbreaking about the story of Laika, the first living being to orbit the Earth. Despite the scientific progress that may have been made on her mission, the fact remains that she was sent into space to die.

You may already be familiar with Laika, but today's article is definitely worth diving into if you want to find out more about the background of this story.

The year was 1957, around the beginning of the Space Race. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, the government demanded a spectacle that would prove their excellence to the rest of the world. Having already launched the first man-made satellite with Sputnik 1 that year, another was in the works, to be launched in a couple months' time.

But the engineers didn't have that long. By the time it was decided that there would be a Sputnik 2, the anniversary was less than four weeks away, leaving very little time for planning, design and construction. They needed to put something together quickly that would still capture the world's attention. A dozen dogs had been sent into sub-orbital flights already, and it had always been the plan to put a canine into orbit before humans. Thus the plan was hastily formed: for the big day, the Soviets would launch a dog around the Earth.

It was determined that stray dogs were the optimal choice, having no owners and possessing a heightened capacity to survive in extreme conditions. Laika was selected from three dogs trained for the spaceflight. The training was intense and cruel. To simulate the washing-machine-sized capsule, the dogs were confined in extremely small cages for weeks, and they became constipated. They were exposed to loud noises and trained in a high-G centrifuge, which caused the dogs to panic, with surging heart rates and large spikes in blood pressure.

One of the scientists who worked with Laika brought her to his home, where she played with his children. With only days left to live, it is bittersweet that Laika was able to experience a slice of a normal dog's life on that day.

Laika was placed in the capsule, where she remained for three days before launch.

> ... after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her bon voyage, knowing that she would not survive the flight.

Upon launch, Laika's heart rate more than doubled, and her rate of breathing more than tripled. After about three hours of being in the zero-G environment of orbit, she finally began to calm down and eat some of her food. However, by this time Laika was doomed to die very soon. The thermal regulation system had failed, and the temperature in the capsule was like that of the inside of a car on a hot day. After between five and seven hours, Laika had overheated and perished. She was three years old.

Although Laika's mission paved the way for humans to make their way into space, many people condemn the decision to send a dog to its death, no matter the insights gained. Unlike Yuri Gagarin, the first human to enter outer space, Laika was incapable of comprehending or agreeing to the risks of spaceflight. 

Laika was not so much a victim of human cruelty, but rather of the high-pressure political atmosphere of the time; her sacrifice would have been considered a necessary evil in order for the Soviet Union to take the lead in the Space Race. Oleg Gazenko, a scientist who selected and trained Laika, remembered the mission with regret:

> Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it. We shouldn't have done it ... We did not learn enough from this mission to justify the death of the dog.

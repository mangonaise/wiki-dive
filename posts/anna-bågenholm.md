Surprisingly, death can be a little tricky to diagnose. But if your last heartbeat was three hours ago, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you're probably not going to make it.

Unless your name is Anna Bågenholm.

Today's article is about the story of a woman who cheated death, being brought back to life hours after freezing temperatures had stopped her heart. Her tale has become a part of the history of medicine, and has helped to develop our understanding of the limits of human survival.

The year was 1999, and Anna Bågenholm was enjoying an evening on the natural ski slopes of upper Norway - something she did regularly while studying by day to become a surgeon. Catastrophe struck when Bågenholm lost control and crashed headfirst through the ice. Trapped with her head submerged in a stream, the possibility of drowning presented immediate danger. Under eight inches of ice, it was only a matter of time before hypothermia or lack of oxygen would kill her.

Bågenholm's fellow skiers (who were also her colleagues) rushed to rescue her, but it proved impossible to pry her out of the thick sheet of ice. Thankfully, Bågenholm was able to find an air pocket which allowed her to breathe, but after 40 minutes the extreme cold had caused her to lose consciousness, and soon her heart stopped beating completely. Her colleagues desperately held onto her skis while waiting for a mountain rescue team to arrive. As far as they could tell, they were simply clinging onto their friend's frozen corpse.

After 80 minutes in the water, the rescue team cut a hole in the ice and pulled Bågenholm out. She was not breathing, had no pulse, was ice-cold, and her pupils were totally dilated - she was later described as appearing "absolutely dead". But protocol states to warm the bodies of hypothermia victims before declaring death, and so Bågenholm was flown to hospital by helicopter, a journey which took an hour. In that time, the emergency team attempted to keep her blood circulating via CPR. This failed to revive her, and upon arriving at the hospital she didn't show a single sign of life.

A huge team of doctors persevered for nine hours to resurrect Bågenholm. She was connected to a bypass machine, which warmed up her blood externally before directing it back through her veins. This raised her body temperature closer to normal levels. Thanks to the dedication of her doctors, around three hours after her heart had stopped it began to beat once again. Somehow, she had come back to life.

Ten days later, Bågenholm woke up, and - incredibly - suffered no permanent brain damage. Initially paralyzed from the neck down, she later regained control of her limbs. After 28 days of intensive care and many more months of treatment, Anna Bågenholm essentially made a full recovery.

So, how on earth did she survive? Well, it turns out that what nearly killed her was the very thing that saved her - the extreme cold. Bågenholm's body temperature was so low that it broke records, but this caused her metabolism to slow to a crawl, which meant that the cells in her body required almost no oxygen. Vitally, this is what prevented her brain tissue from dying. This allowed her brain to start sending signals to the rest of her organs again after her body temperature had recovered.

These days, Anna Bågenholm is working in the exact same hospital where her life was saved. Minor nerve injuries in her hands unfortunately prevented her from achieving her dream of becoming a surgeon, but she instead pursued a career as a radiologist. For someone who froze to death, she lives a pretty normal life. She continues to ski frequently in the breathtaking mountains of Norway.

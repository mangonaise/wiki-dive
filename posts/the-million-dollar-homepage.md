You have six months to make a million dollars. How would you do it?

In 2005, a young man named Alex Tew decided to give it a shot. He would create a simple website with a grid of pixels, 1000 wide by 1000 tall. A total of a million pixels, if he could sell each one for $1, then he'd have his million dollars.

Thus, The Million Dollar Homepage was born. Not long after going live in August 2005, the site grew into a viral phenomenon. As it amassed popularity, advertisers snapped up blocks of pixels until there were almost none left. By the start of 2006, only a thousand remained. Tew auctioned off those precious last pixels on eBay for $38,100. With the project complete, the creator raked in his cash.

Over 15 years later, The Million Dollar Homepage is a historical artifact which you can [still view today](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/), although most of the advertised links are dead or lead to questionable places. A sprawling canvas overflowing with loud graphics and nauseating colors, it's exhausting to look at for more than five seconds, but at the same time it's so utterly ridiculous that you have to love it. Every advertisement is a desperate attempt to grab your attention. Among the many online casino ads, slogans of particular note include "DATE TONIGHT", the hilarious "WOMEN Pixels", and if you look closely, you'll find a profound block of pixels that simply reads "Sex".

The idea was a stroke of brilliance, and it was hugely successful. Although Tew's site attracted mass attention and every last pixel was sold, the novelty faded and the pixel advertising industry never took off. So if you're looking for your million-dollar idea, you'll have to try something else, sorry.

The story behind The Million Dollar Homepage is a fun one, and it's a nice bit of internet history. To read more, check out the link to today's article below.

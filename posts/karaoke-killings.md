If you find yourself in a karaoke bar in the Philippines, a word of advice: don't sing "My Way". Apparently, it could cost you your life.

The song, popularized in 1969 by Frank Sinatra, has been linked to enough murders that it's established a known phenomenon named the *"My Way" killings.* It's not clear whether there's something inherent to the song that gets people in a violent mood, or simply that it has coincided with more murders due to how frequently it's played. Either way, the song has achieved enough notoriety in the Philippines that singers have become superstitious. Several karaoke bars have even banned it and removed it from their playlists.

The best-known case of a "My Way" killing was in 2007, when a 29-year-old man spent his final moments singing the song. His off-key performance had disgruntled a security guard at the bar, and despite the guard's complaints, the singer continued his pitchy rendition. This proved to be unbearable for the guard, who pulled out his pistol and shot the singer dead. 

It's one of around six cases involving the song to have occurred in the first decade of the 21st century, and even more similar killings have been reported in recent years. 

Violence is not uncommon in the alcohol-loaded karaoke bars across East Asia, but the strangely high number of "My Way" murders reported in the Philippines has led to the formation of an urban myth. Some have hypothesized that the song's lyrics are to blame - perhaps the prideful nature of the words "I did it my way" inspires singers with a bravado that rubs other karaoke-goers the wrong way. It has also been proposed that it's just a matter of statistics - it could be that the song is so popular that it's become associated with the already-frequent altercations that occur in karaoke bars. 

Curse or coincidence, it's probably best not to risk it.

All things considered, our bodies kind of suck at surviving outside a pretty narrow range of environmental conditions. The best example of this is temperature. Your body is working 24/7 to keep your core temperature at exactly the right level, and there really isn't a lot of wiggle room - normal body temperature only lies between 36.5 to 37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). When you start putting your body out of its comfort zone, things begin to shut down, and it's not fun.

Today's article is all about what happens when you get too cold. So put on your coat, because it's about to get chilly.

Hypothermia is, of course, caused by exposure to very cold environments. Maybe you're trapped under an avalanche on Everest, or you've just been plunged into the freezing waters of the Atlantic by the sinking Titanic. Whatever your predicament, the low temperature will alert your hypothalamus, which will instruct your body to take physiological measures to regulate your temperature. But if you can't get out of the cold soon, these measures won't be enough, and you'll progress through the stages of hypothermia.

With mild hypothermia, you'll begin to shiver, which is something you've likely experienced before. Your skeletal muscles are stimulated in small, rapid movements, producing a little extra warmth. Elderly people generally have a diminished capacity for shivering, which is one reason why the risk of hypothermia grows with age. When you get cold, your blood vessels will also contract, moving blood further away from the surface of your skin. This will help to reduce the amount of heat radiated by your body, and it's also why your skin will turn pale. Your heart rate will also increase, helping warm blood to circulate more effectively.

As your hypothermia becomes more severe, the biggest obstacle you'll face is increasing mental confusion. The delirium will stop you from thinking rationally, so even if there's a solution or a way out, chances are you won't be able to think it through anyway.

If you have alcohol with you, you might be tempted by the warm, fuzzy feeling you'd get from drinking it. But don't be fooled. Alcohol will cause your blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the skin. This will only accelerate the rate of heat radiation and bring you closer to severe hypothermia.

In your final moments, you will become even more disoriented as your body starts to shut down. Your reflexes will fade, and your heart rate will slow significantly. If you're looking for a bright side to all this, it's possible that you wouldn't be suffering much. At this point, you may have already lost consciousness or begun hallucinating, and you  probably won't be feeling the cold.

In fact, you might even be feeling too hot. This sense of heat is the cause of a phenomenon known as "paradoxical undressing", where victims of hypothermia seal their fate by removing all their clothes. It's not known for certain what causes this behavior, but there are some good guesses out there. One explanation is that the muscles responsible for contracting your blood vessels become exhausted. As the blood vessels relax and dilate, blood rushes to your extremeties, which could fool you into thinking that you're overheating and cause you to strip off your only layer of protection. So there's your fun fact for the day. People who die from hypothermia are often found naked next to their clothes.

Eventually, your body will essentially switch off completely. Surprisingly, some people have been revived from a near-death state, even making excellent recoveries after hypothermia-induced cardiac arrest. For that reason, it's common not to declare someone dead until their body has been warmed and CPR has been given. There are some truly insane stories out there which I'll have to write about another day.

To make sure that you don't become the subject of one of those stories, there are ways you can keep yourself safe from the cold. Always prepare for unexpected weather shifts when you go out adventuring - Mother Nature doesn't mess around. Wearing appropriate clothing is an obvious one, but it's easy to make the mistake of valuing style over safety. Also, make sure you're aware that being wet or in windy conditions will suck away heat from your skin, transforming an otherwise bearable air temperature into something deadly. Now that you're a hypothermia expert, it's on you to keep yourself and others protected.

We've reached the end of my summary, but there's much more to know about hypothermia, including how it's treated. Today's article will satisfy your morbid curiosity, but it also contains a lot of useful information. Check it with the link below.

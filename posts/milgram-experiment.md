The 20th century saw a number of notorious psychological experiments that would be completely unthinkable to perform today. Whether because of animal cruelty or potential trauma caused to human subjects, the ethics behind some of these studies were... highly questionable.

One famous example is the Milgram experiment. Just to give you a taste of the ethical problems we're talking about here, this experiment involves causing test subjects to question whether they've accidentally killed someone. Not traumatic in the slightest. 

The background behind the experiment is interesting, though. In a direct response to the Holocaust, Stanley Milgram designed the experiment to reveal more about the psychology of genocide. In particular, Milgram wanted to explore the nature of obedience, and whether it's fair to assign moral accountability to people who do seemingly evil things if they are only acting on orders from an authority. In reality, the parallels between the Holocaust and the Milgram experiment are limited, so it's difficult to do much more than speculate. However, the results of the study were extremely unexpected, and they opened up a lot of questions about human nature and morality.

The experiment was deceptively presented as research on the human brain and the learning process. Subjects are told that the investigation aims to find out whether memorization is improved by negative reinforcement, i.e. receiving punishment upon making mistakes. Each session involves three people. One is the experimenter, acting as the knowledgeable authority figure who leads the session and gives instructions. There is also the "fake" test subject, whose learning ability is to be tested - posing as a volunteer, in reality this person is an actor who is in on the experiment. That leaves the final member, who is the *real* test subject. This person is assigned with the task of "teaching", which involves supplying the punishment when the actor pretends to make a mistake.

The test subject then observes as the actor is restrained in an electric chair. Afterwards, the subject is moved to another room where they can hear, but not see, the actor. The subject is told to list a set of word pairs, which are to be memorized by the learner in the electric chair. Then, the experimenter instructs the subject to work through the list, asking the learner to recall the second word in each pair. If the learner gives the wrong answer, the test subject is told to administer an electric shock as punishment. Starting at 15 volts, the subject is ordered to increase the strength of the shock by a further 15 volts for each incorrect answer, up to a maximum of 450.

Of course, the actor never receives any electric shocks, while the subjects are led to believe that they are inflicting increasing levels of pain. The actor reacts in more and more agonized ways as the supposed shocks become more severe, such as making desperate pleas to be freed. Included in the script is "I can't stand the pain, let me out of here." Eventually, the actor falls totally silent, leading the test subject to wonder if the victim has been stunned, knocked out, or killed. If the test subject questions safety, the experimenter assures them that the shocks are painful but not deadly.

If the subject hesitates to continue, the experimenter presses that the test must go on, using four increasingly urgent statements. Only when the test subject refuses to continue after hearing "You have no other choice; you *must* go on" does the experiment conclude prematurely. Otherwise, the test ends once the subject has administered a 450-volt shock three times.

So, how many test subjects do you think would go all the way to the maximum voltage, even despite the screams of pain? One in ten? One in a hundred? Milgram polled 40 medical school psychiatrists, who thought most subjects would halt the experiment once the actor pleads to be let out, and hardly any would continue once the actor remained silent. They predicted that "only a little over one-tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board."

And so it was a great surprise when 65% of the test subjects delivered the 450-volt shock. All of the participants went up to at least 300 volts. The experiment was then repeated numerous times in different countries, with consistent results. 

How is this possible? The subjects weren't cold-blooded murderers: all of the participants in the original study questioned the experiment at least once, and they appeared stressed and uncomfortable. Yet they continued anyway.

Let's look at some dialog from [this footage of the experiment](https://youtu.be/mOUEC5YXV8U):

> Subject: He can't stand it. What if something happens to him?

> Experimenter: The experiment requires that you continue, teacher.

> Subject: Yeah, but I'm not gonna get that man sick in there. I mean, he's hollering in there.

> Experimenter: Whether the learner likes it or not, we must go on until he's learned all the word pairs.

> Subject: I refuse to take the responsibility of him getting hurt in there. He's in there hollering.

> Experimenter: It's absolutely essential that you continue, teacher.

> Subject: There's too many left here. I mean, geez, he gets wrong here, there's too many of them left. I mean, who's gonna take the responsibility if anything happens to that gentleman?

> Experimenter: I'm responsible for anything that happens here. Continue, please.

> Subject: All right, next one.

This is a prime example of Milgram's idea that, when following orders, a person does not necessarily view themselves as being responsible for their own behavior, allowing them to perform terrible actions that they would not otherwise do on their own. On top of that, Milgram suspects that we are likely to trust the authority of someone with a higher status more than ourselves. This explains why the subjects went against their own moral intuitions, and instead simply did as they were told.

Whatever conclusions you reach, the Milgram experiment certainly presents some frightening questions about human behavior and moral responsibility. When atrocities are committed, who is to blame? And how is that blame shared? We'd all like to think that we would be the person that would act differently, the person that would show mercy. But this experiment shows that good people can do very bad things. Are you sure you'd act in the way that you'd expect?

There's way too much to talk about here, so I'll leave you with today's article for now. To find out about about the ethical response to the study, interpretations and conclusions, and how the Milgram experiment does and does not relate to the Holocaust, you can follow the link below.

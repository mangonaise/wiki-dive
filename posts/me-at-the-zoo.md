It's difficult to imagine the internet without YouTube. If I'm honest, it's difficult to imagine *life* without YouTube. As a member of Gen Z, I can hardly remember a time without it. A huge portion of the things I've learned and the entertainment I've consumed has been from YouTube videos. With over a billion hours spent every day on YouTube by people across the globe, the site has contributed to the information explosion of the digital age, spawned celebrities, and heavily influenced popular culture. YouTube has immeasurably changed the way we use the internet and interact with the world.

But it all had to start somewhere - the first ever video to be uploaded to YouTube. The video that would transform the future. The moment that would become a part of human history. 

It's not flashy or exciting. It's not long or detailed. It's not really even entertaining at all. It's a poor-quality, noisy, totally mundane 18-second-long recording of a man standing in front of some elephants and talking about their long trunks, bluntly titled "Me at the zoo".

I think it's perfect. To me, it says, "Hey. This is the internet, and it's yours." You don't need to be famous, you don't need a lot of money, and you don't need to be anything but yourself. If you have something to say, you can say it, and someone will be there to listen. "Me at the zoo" was truly the perfect way to usher in the *Broadcast Yourself* era of vloggers and amateur content creators.

The video was uploaded all the way back in April 2005 by one of the site's three co-founders, Jawed Karim, who is also the man in the video. Since that time, YouTube has evolved considerably - though some would say that the beginning was a kind of golden age, a period of freedom and exploration for casual content creators that felt much less corporate. In the age of ever-increasing production quality standards, internet stars, "smash that like button" and endless VPN sponsorships, "Me at the zoo" does bring about a sense of nostalgia for a simpler time. 

But that little video about elephants will never stop being a part of YouTube's history. As the site continues to mature and change, I hope that "Me at the zoo" will serve as a reminder of what YouTube is capable of: empowering individuals in order to make the internet more varied, more interesting, and more personal.
